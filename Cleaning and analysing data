This flow includes the work after having downloaded the kaggle dataset and connected the postgres application to the Tableau desktop application.
The dataset link can be found from the readme file.

We first create the table naming "world_population" by using the pgadmin interface.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public."world_population"
(
    "Rank" integer primary key,
    "CCA3" VARCHAR(50),
    "Country" VARCHAR(50),
    "Capital" VARCHAR(50),
    "Continent" VARCHAR(50),
    "2022_Population" integer,
    "2020_Population" integer,
    "2015_Population" integer,
    "2010_Population" integer,
    "2000_Population" integer,
    "1990_Population" integer,
    "1980_Population" integer,
    "1970_Population" integer,
    "Area_km2" integer,
    "Density_per_km2" DECIMAL(10,4),
    "Growth_Rate" DECIMAL(7,4),
    "World_Population_Percentage" DECIMAL(5,2)
)

TABLESPACE pg_default;

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public."world_population"
    OWNER to postgres;
    
At this point, you can proceed to get the data from the file by choosing one among three options. I've chosen to get it with the copy function.
If face any trouble with file reading authorisation, you need to grant authorisation to everyone for the relevant file that you download from the Kaggle.

COPY public."world_population"("Rank","CCA3","Country","Capital","Continent","2022_Population","2020_Population","2015_Population","2010_Population","2000_Population","1990_Population","1980_Population","1970_Population","Area_km2","Density_per_km2","Growth_Rate","World_Population_Percentage") 
FROM 'C:\Users\90537\Downloads\world_population.csv' 
DELIMITER ',' 
CSV HEADER;
